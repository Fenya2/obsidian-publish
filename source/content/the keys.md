context:

- had moved into a new house recently
- everything was everywhere and my desk w crowded
- for *some* reason i felt the need to go upstairs to put my keys down only to go down stairs again to get a drink (why couldnt i have just walked down stairs the first place? i didnt have foresight, but it felt automatic bc at that point i was building new habits/enter house-go to room)
