this is no mistake, the #body feels safe with it in the hands, so it assimilates it (like borg).
The #body  only knows truth. its the mind that lies.
it does so to protect itself, it doesnt know the difference between truth and lies, its the one that files the controls.(determines meaning).
The #body doesnt know anything other than truth, it cant lie it has no mechanism of such
