i was driving having what i called "insights"
burst of information i had that would come to me like i was magnetised to them.
i took them, absorbed them and spoke them like they were fact (it didnt metter if they were) more wiring anf firing within my brain gave me information that either confirmed the statements or denied then.
i changed my stance and perspective from the confirmation and kept going.
at this point i felt a convergence within the rl movements i was doing.
I sensed the car next to me, and wanted to over take him, i could either
- slow down and let him in my lane or
- speed up and overtake him which leaves space for him to merge into my lane.
i assessed and decided to speed up since i was already going wquite slow and so was he, "there are people coming up behind me" i thought.
as i sped up nd was over taking him i felt this strange sensation(like he was going to hit me, this fear) and checked he was still next to me in the lane, he was (fear gone, no need to worry).
I turned back to watch the road and saw his car, superimposed onto of my car and watched for about 30seconds as this car was literally driving out of my car.
i confirmed my experience by turning to my passenger and asking if they could see what i was seeing while it was happening and did indeed confirm they were seeing what i was seeing.
As the car moved away from me this sensation of "huh" but in a calm curious way left and i was behind the car that i intended to and began to pass.

ive not had any experience's like this since and i will preface this by saying i dont take psychedelics and never have, i also dont have any schizophrenic tendencies (have been checked).

"In physics and systems theory, the superposition principle, also known as superposition property, states that, for all linear systems, the net response caused by two or more stimuli is the sum of the responses that would have been caused by each stimulus individually"
