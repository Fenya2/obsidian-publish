you know what sex is?
a science experiment, between two *willing* participants.
see: "A systematic method or body of knowledge in a given area".
You're learning about each others wants, needs, desires and are working *together* to achieve pleasure, if you shall choose completion (sometimes the body chooses this for you).
Experiments are only fun when they involve both parties, otherwise you get abuse, manipulation, all the bad shit etc. this is how we solve these systemic issues in culture/communities. By quite literally exposing them and having them held in loving ways. It will be hard (it always is being on the cutting edge) but it will be worth it (it always is).
I once explained to an ex poly partner who got very upset that i post a video of both us playing music and at the end it was us passionately kissing to my social media, because they were scared (i didnt respect their wishes which i should have in hindsight) *but* i noticed there was beauty in this moment and *also* that their shame wasnt mine shame. i wasnt going to carry that for them. I was going to spread the love and by doing so broke their trust code they set for themselves.
They mentioned i *crossed a line* but i was insistent that it wasnt a line, it was an *edge*.

In the end they told the social media gods that it was actually their video (i was the one who had full access to it, i recorded it, if we wanna get petty, ill own that and say if it wasnt for me *choosing* to record it, it wouldnt exist in the moment, and yes, we both loved the fact that i recorded it at the time, it was *concensual*) and blocked me. So even if i chose to post it after they blocked me, then i *couldnt* upload it at all to that platform bc it was copywriten to them (which was *so hurtful* to me, it was the equivalent of rubbing salt in the wound).

This isnt the way, but in sharing this story it helps us get a better idea of this concept.
