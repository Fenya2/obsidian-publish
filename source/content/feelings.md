i feel sick. i feel like ive been pulled down to earth, reality check.
causing another hurt never feels good, even if its in pursuit of something greater than me.
I dont want to fight that feeling, i let it wash over me.
but i dont feel like crying for me, i feel like crying for her.
i wish i could say im sad, but i understand. i understand the hurt, i understand the power of my actions and i wont fall back into destructive habits (reminder!!!! dont go backwards). its such a weird feeling being on the precipice of this research bc its life changing, heart shattering and all round vulnerable and thats a scary thing.
its a scary thing to feel this in my body. its a scary thing to feel my heart break. my body knew this was coming...
it could feel it.
my chest pains were my heart telling me. ive still got so much to learn about my body.
this research is helping me but also harming me (light and dark).
its a fine line.
its best i be honest.
what i loved in nat was the way they saw the world. it was so beautiful, and i broke their trust to be able to be part of their beautiful world, and experience the way they see the world.
thats what hurts the most.
touch is something that moves and changes but the way we see the world is changed by choice.
my choice was to explore this without talking about it with them bc i was scared to be honest about what i really want.
being scared of my own reality is a funny thing.
im scared being who i am will hurt the ones i choose to love, for past experiences have shown me that is true....but something deep tells me its just not true for the ones who truely see me.
the ones i show this whole self to.
who desire to know all of me, every single piece.
all pieces of me deserve love.
not just the ones that make other people comfortable.

nat and i breaking up is a big part of this.
a part of me realising that this is a big piece of me that deserves love just like the rest.
it hurts so much bc ive lost someone i admire, i was inspired by, but its also so beautiful to witness the parts of me still yearning to be loved. i am loveable, i am deeply loveable as i am.
this is a scary thought.
a very scary thought.
i feel vulnerable. exposed. naked.
i feel like patrick on the pedestal in spongebob. aellas banner.
i feel like i am on trial in a witch hunt.
i feel so exposed as these tears stream down my face.
im cracked open.
pieces of my heart floating in stasis...
i can see them...i cant feel them...
i remind myself that this is where love to enters.
cracks dont mean im broken, it means more sunlight can enter.
not avoidant to this pain, but witnessing it in all of its parts.
i heard the words "hurt deserves a seat at the table just like everyone else" last night as i went to bed, respecting this now as i know what my mind was preparing me for.
this hurt is a beautiful thing, even if it doesnt feel like it right now.
I couldnt keep them/her, for she wasnt mine to keep.
i cannot keep that which i have not shown myself fully, wholly. it will always end in chaos.
it becomes delicate, like glass swirling through space. 
space is dangerous, its filled with rocks big and small that could fracture any piece of the parts ive only shown.
i long to build a strong structure.
A spaceship big enough to catch the rocks and turn them into solid gold.
A collection of all of me that is strong, yet soft. can bend and move and shift.
that can change with choice. that is strong enough to speak the truth even though it hurts.
for hurt deserves a piece at the table, just like everyone else.
everyone deserves a seat at the table. (all emotions, all humans, all beings)


i am sad, i am sad, i can feel the sad even though i understand. i can, and am completely

im not a lier, im just ashamed.


if am squishy, you cant stab squishy.
