i havnt seen them in a while, they were attached in my mind to a point in time that was v terrorising, but theyve started to appear again recently.
i knew this though, but i didnt know why but i can map it.
a few weeks ago (around date: #22nd/23rd Feb) i had a thought that i havnt seen them around and was wondering if its bc i chose to not notice them, but that didnt feel "right" (good), so i just left that thought and randomly trusted that if i was truth it would find me.
ive just realised that, it isnt the case.
i wasnt placing them, i was following them, even when i was doing it years ago, i wasnt looking for them on purpose, its like they were [*magnetised*] to me. i kept seeing them and then more would come, it got to the point at which i would see them consecutively in order 0-9, and they would begin again many times a day.]
they stopped meaning anything bc i didnt assign them anything - i created the meaning (as the mind does).
I stopped noticing them, the #meaning left.

Theyve reappeared, not bc ive been looking for them but bc i was *wondering* about them.
Literally creating it, *somehow*.
I feel like this is #measurable.
The time it took for me to wonder, the amount of time spent on wondering (less ten 1min). days between the wonder and next instance: 11 (HA double. number lol)
