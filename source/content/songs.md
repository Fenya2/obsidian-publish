I hear songs as messages, im starting to get it now. at first it was random but there is *reason* in why a certain part of a song, or a song itself gets sticky in the mind.

For time and date proof: just joined this _spirit_ discord. have the song "at last" in my mind (by the one and only ella) The part that plays over and over it in my mind is: "the skys above are blue, here we are in heaven, for you are mine, at last"
