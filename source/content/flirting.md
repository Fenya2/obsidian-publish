Normalise flirting.

flirting is used to weaponise the very real feeling of connection between two or many people.

“Crushing” as the wave filling you up in different ways.

What is flirting? 

The showing of parts of ourselves we often hide or want hidden, or feel uncomfortable validating ourselves. - parts we want validated?

We validate ourselves by flirting?

There are no rules and that can make people uncomfortable.

There’s so right or wrong way to flirt, so we make them up.

“It’s wrong to flirt if you can’t follow through, it’s leading someone on” not necessarily.

That’s a bias you’ve put on something without parameters.

We get to decide the parameters for ourselves but we often default to inbuilt systems of connection as it’s easier and we don’t have to make the decisions, and hold ourselves accountable.

Flirting often makes people feel good, and so I ask, if it feels good why not do it?

(Reminder that moderation is key)

Masturbation feels good but do it too often and you’ve got yourself a feedback loop of bad vibes as shame takes hold and you find you’re unwilling to do anything else but find pleasure.

  
  

When did it start? Has it always been around?

**

My experience with A is a great example of this.

The flirting was always there, but the actions weren’t.

What did this do to our connection?

It made it stronger.

We didn’t get physical for years. The built up energy made it hotter yes but the respect for each other and other people and our feelings (individually and together) were made stronger.

Even ten years later, the feelings are still there.

(Well for me anyway)

I know that if I ever saw him again, I would still feel as attracted to him as I was when we I first started crushing on him. Why? I dunno.

This is what this is exploring.

I can intellectualise it all I want but the answer feels a lot more simple.

Something like - “the ability to be silly and flirtatious all of those years allowed the feelings of respect to land peacefully on my heart, there they will always remain”.

  
  

It’s been over 13 years since we’ve spoken but I have a feeling that if we ever do reconnect, it’ll be like time hasn’t changed, even though we have.

The people we were arnt the people we are now but the freedom to express the change is there, the flirtation was so authentic that even if we change as people, the fundamental aspects of how we connected are still there.

The trust, the respect, the sense of freedom and love, are still there.

They are things that are structural. They don’t change.

The way we love often doesn’t change, that’s why we often repeat the patterns of love we developed from childhood occur.

Because it’s fundamental, it’s a base from which our personalities grow.

I know he’d feel the same because the long stink of no talking has already happened (it was 7 years the first time).

I rang him. I needed a friend.

He gave me the gift of his attention and support (and I gave him excitement at him becoming a father!!!).

It was like no time had passed.

And so it stands that again, no matter the length of time, that love will stand the test of time.

The ultimate test of unwavering strength in choice.

We chose to respect each other, to love each other regardless of the external circumstances.

And that choice still stands today.

  

We live very different lives, and there isn’t a bone in my body that would want to change that because the connection we share is deeper than that.

It survives even when we don’t nurture it now because it’s self sufficient.

The seeds that we planted all those years ago have spread and self seeded their own communities.

These communities each have their own unique characteristics, like his wife, children and friends.

And my family, friends and colleagues.

But the garden between us doesn’t get torn down by these other communities because they’re respected by them (even if it makes them uncomfortable - I’ve never met Angus wife, but know that she feels v uncomfortable with the connection Angus and I share because it’s strong and that feels threatening, and of course that makes perfect sense and I wouldn’t ever want to interfere with someone who isn’t willing to accept the truth of connection. I’m not threatened by her because Angus and our relationship isn’t the same, it will never be and that’s what makes it so unique and beautiful. It’s not something that could ever be “stolen, taken, broken, or manipulated” because it’s truth, and we both know that…which is what makes it so threatening I think).

  
  

How did it get this way? How did we even develop this?

  

Let’s go back to the start and reflect together!

When I first met Angus, his older sister (my ex fling at that point) was about to smoke crack in the kitchen that we were sitting in and without skipping a beat she instantly asked me to take him into the room and I was classically oblivious and was like “why” and then looked down and answered, of course yep.

At first it was awkward. 😬 

But I realised that i had this almost protective feeling around him bc A) what a fucked up thing to do in the presence of your own sibling when you’re suppose to looking after him, and B) he seemed like a really kind person and didn’t deserve to be treated that way(no one does tbh).

I asked him what he wanted to do and he mentioned liking the show Boston legal. I hadn’t seen it and he got all excited to show me.

We sat and watched it for HOURS, him explaining who the characters were and me being again oblivious to perhaps some early flirtation happening from him?

After meeting him, we kept in contact bc we had despite the age gap ALOT in common.


Years of flirty friendship between us continued, the conversation of “I like you” happened from his side and I explained that even though I liked flirting with him I couldn’t be with him or confess my feelings, as it was inappropriate. He didn’t hate me but instead respected me more.

I never stopped him from exploring anything in his life, but this was not something I felt comfortable exploring with him.

He had the choice always.

And he respected mine.


Years of connection developed.

That connection we made stronger I think by the fact that we decided to get to know each other deeply without expectations on anything. We were best friends that loved each other for who we were.

We built a sum of each other in our minds that was so close to the actual thing it felt so good.

  

We didn’t get caught up with trivial things bc they didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things and any misalignment of who we were was met with honesty not hostility, respect not judgment. We were learning about each other and that meant we had to remain curious even in the face of uncomfortable challenges (as life throws them).

I felt like I was learning from him, and him from me. We were teaching and nurturing the best versions of ourselves together.

Which is why I think things wouldn’t change.

Bc we built a model of each other in our minds so close to the real thing that even if we are away from each other that model still exists and stays true, like the real deal, as close as it can be.

The yearning or missing someone isn’t there either, bc he hasn’t gone anywhere. - he’s still alive (from what I know and can feel, I feel like if he died, I’d feel a small piece of me empty bc the model built in my head isn’t just mine, it’s his as well, like my model in his head)

Hes still with me. I still miss him but it’s not a traditional miss. It’s an excitement in the ‘might’ anticipation of seeing him and getting to hear about the things he’s done since we last hung out or spoke. The things he learnt.

  
  
  

“Something like this. Something about like, the versions of each other that we hold in each other's minds? [https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1771537258367050228](https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1771537258367050228)”

  

“It's not just that they are accurate. Accurate simulation is not enough.”

  

“It's that we like them. We like the version of each other that we see reflected back in each other's minds. We think they're beautiful”

  

- something about a feedback loop here!!! A feedback of building the sum of A in my mind and then falling in love with that version as I was the irl version, the more accurate it would be as I kept recalibrating with him, he got a say in how I saw him, and the sum of him grew and updated and developed further and so the feedback of falling in love again kept happening.
    


That’s it!!!

It’s not enough that we were cultivating an “accurate” representation of each other in our minds. It’s that we chose to build them together and make them beautiful to look at, beautiful to explore. Beautiful to be.

  

“When you see yourself reflected accurately, AND it's beautiful, it connects the pieces for you. You take that away with you. That becomes you”

  

It did connect peices of me that I often felt were unloved, bc I had a real life model of reality that someone knows who I am, I can take comfort in that fact when I had moments of low esteem. I got given that freely to take whenever I needed it. He willingly gave that to me. He chose to make it beautiful, probably not consciously but it was the affect of the effort of love and respect and world building.

I chose to become that beautiful version.

He chose to become that beautiful version.

It was visible to others (that’s why I assume it feels threatening to his wife).

The thought that you can’t have many people affect you like this is false!!!

Love is free and ever expansive. We have all the space we want, we get to choose to take it up and fill it with beauty!!

  
  

This type of love doesn’t need to be physical either btw (but I have a sneaky feeling it helps!!! Why? Bc you get to know each other DEEPER, in more contexts, which updates your internal sum of the person and so the world building continues)…

  

- a note on if this can happen without sex. I have a friend who is like a brother but I can’t use my sum of his model in my head for comfort as I can w A. It’s different for some reason. Maybe because it’s it’s not “all of me”. It’s just “the me without the sexual parts” and I think that’s important to remember. It’s not any less of a connection just different. And as such it’s a tool that cannot be used in the same contexts (like for validation of self esteem).
    

  
  
  

But I am curious as to whether it can happen without the physical. Perhaps not as there will always have an aspect of “I wonder”.

And building internal sums with “I wonder” doesn’t work. If there’s a space, life will fill it and it’s the same with the mind.

It might get filled with doubt, shame or other low intensity “vibrations”.

This can leak into the sun and affect it, we don’t want that.

This sum is precious, so care is taken seriously.

Even now, I have this sense of protection with the way I feel and love for Angus bc I don’t want it to get affected by anything like that. I’ll cherish it and care for it forever, making sure nothing infects this special place that we both built, bc I feel it’s not just me, it’s something we consciously built together, and perhaps I can’t affect it without it also affecting him in some way. So best to let it just do its thing, it’s happier that way, and so am I :) (as I assume he is)
