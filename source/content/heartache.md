to feel my heart break is to know its expanding.
to learn.
to combine the intellectual and the physical in ways only ever imaginable until now.
i know ican map this, research this and want to.
its giving me energy that i couldnt know i had.
energy for love.
knowing more about myself and what my own soul craves.
my heart.


"youre intellectulaising it" - yeah.
is that a bad thing?
why is intellectualising sex considered a bad thing?
Why cant my mind be involved in the pleasure? is it not allowed?
why does my mind have to be absent in the presence of pleasure?
social norms, thats why, bc there hasnt ever been a way to involve the mind during sex, only that it "disconnects sex" - im going against a very big grain here.
