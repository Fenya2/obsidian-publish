i love thinking of new app ideas or ways to make websites/social media better. (i did this with myspace and layouts that changed the function of the page, i did this with vapirefreaks and the cults*groups* they allowed. scraper bots to invite those who resonated with my welcome msg was the best tbh)
ways of getting a wider frame of reference. a ways of mapping how people interact. *can i map emotions through word searches?*
i need this to work, i need this to become so easy that i speak into the void and get a clear picture/prototype for it.
this will happen. AI can make this happen, open source can make this happen. i can make this happen.[[horny]][[feelings]][[body]][[ai]]
